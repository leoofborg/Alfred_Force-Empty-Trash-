# Alfred 2 "Force Empty Trash" Workflow #

Quick, dirty, made in between coffee fixes.

## Why?

Because the one I found at the [Alfred Forums](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1474-force-empty-trash/?p=16858) didn't work. 

## Requires

- Mac OS X, why? BECAUSE.
- Alfred 2

## QuickStart

- Download the zip or clone from Github
- Double click to import into Alfred.
- READ THE README IN THE WORKFLOW. People forget this, right?
- Invoke Alfred, type 'force'

### Usage

DURRRRRRRR see above.

### Workarounds

None needed. Yet.

### Warranties

NONE. This was cooked up in LESS an hour. Use as thou wilt. Works for me, YMMV.
